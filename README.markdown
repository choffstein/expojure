# Expojure

Expojure helps you track errors in your Clojure applications via customized dispatch methods

## Dispatch
The currently written dispatch methods are for

* Console Printing
* getexceptional.com
* Local file (json-format for later dispatch to getexceptional -- see https://github.com/Greplin/greplin-exception-catcher for design thoughts)

## Roll Your Own
To add your own dispatch extensions to the library, simply construct a function that takes an Exception class, and handle it!  You could write it to your logs, a database, or send it by carrier pigeon!

## Usage
There are two ways of using this library.  The first is the local-try macro, which is just like a normal try block, but the first parameter is a list of dispatch methods.  e.g.

      (expojure.core.local-try [expojure.dispatchers.console/print-dispatch] 
      			       (/ 1 0)
  			       (catch ArithmeticException e (println "Whoops, exception!")))

Global try is a bit different.  It allows you to set up a set of dispatch functions that get called anytime global-try is used.  So instead of having to put your console, file, and server logger into local-try every time, you can just add them via add-dispatch-function, and use global try.

       (expojure.dispatchers/add-dispatch-function [expojure.dispatchers.exceptional/exceptional-dispatch])
       (expojure.core.global-try (/ 1 0)
  				 (catch ArithmeticException e (println "Whoops, exception!")))

So why use one over another?  Local try is convenient when you want to set up different dispatch methods for different actions.  Perhaps some actions only require shallow logging.  Perhaps other actions require deeper logging to a service like getexceptional.com.  Using global-try locks you into your global-list.  local-try, while requiring a few more key-strokes, provides you the flexibility to use whatever dispatchers you want for that specific block.  Technically, global-try is just local-try with the global list passed in.
